# MicrosoftVisualCSharp
This repository will contain the problems, exercises and my solutions from the book: Microsoft Visual C# Step by Step Nineth Edition

The repository will be used to track my progress through the book.

Not all of the problems covered will be in this repository, due to the file contents being too large to upload.

I will be uploading others seperately.

This exercise was about creating and using various types of arrays (jagged and multidimensional arrays) to manipulate sets of data.
